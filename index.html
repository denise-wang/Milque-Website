      <h2>
        <a class="em-text">Milque</a> is a collective founded on inclusivity, 
        artistic freedom, and friendship. In the spirit of collaborative success, 
        we have curated an artistic community to join together in the pursuit of 
        making worthwhile art. Talent is everywhere, yet typically only well funded 
        artists have access to <a class="em-text">proper studios and capable 
        collaborators</a>. Expensive studio rates and a limited network leave 
        most artists with unprofessional products and an incomplete suite of content. 
        To address this, we've created a community called <a class="em-text">
        The Campus</a>, located in West LA. The Campus is a workspace outfitted with 
        <a class="em-text">industry standard audio and visual production tools</a> 
        for artists to congregate and create expressive and professional art, that can 
        then be promoted via an on-site event venue and our exclusive marketing channels.
